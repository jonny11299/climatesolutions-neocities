        <h2>Angst --> Positive Action.</h2>
        <p>The goal is to take a complex problem (climate change) and break it into actionable steps, so that people can have fun engaging with nature, building projects, creating positive outcomes, and feeling like a part of an important cause.</p>
        <p>Problems range from "Simple lifestyle change" to "Sustained manual labor outdoors" to "Help the Earth from your laptop" to "Hey, imagine this climate-friendly business idea."</p>
        <p>Check out the <a href="solutions.html">Solutions</a> page to explore exciting ways to help the Earth heal.</p>
        <p>This website is largely a blog + home for the ideas that fly through my noggin.</p>
        <p>I intend to dedicate my life to developing solutions to help the Earth, our communities, and nature heal. I want to pass on a world to our descendents that's worthwhile and full of love, life, and purpose.</p>
