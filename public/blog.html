        <h2>First Blog Post, 3 Sept 2025:</h2>
        <p>Background:</p>

        <p>1. For decades, scientists have urgently stressed the necessity of making a safer, more eco-friendly world -- scaling back emissions, prototyping systems that are more sustainable, and truly developing solutions in a deep manner.</p>

        <p>2. Artists and activists have joined the cause, and amplified their voices.</p>

        <p>3. Capitalism has prioritized greed over gratitude, and here in 2025, these solutions lay stuck in the mud.</p>

        <p>4. As we watch Trump unravel the few protections offered to wildlife, nature, indigenous folks, marginalized voices, poor people, etc. -- it becomes increasingly clear that nobody is going to save us but ourselves.</p>

        <p>5. Politicians do not give a shit. The rich do not give a shit. Nobody is coming to save us. We have to find solutions ourselves.</p>

        <p>6. My generation is largely obsessed with curating our own brand images on social media, and overwhelmed in the amount of information available to us. Technology didn't just offer a supplement to the rich social networks of years prior -- it replaced them. It addicted us. Covid combined with this to make us awkward. Communities have been dissolved over the years, such that this world barely resembles the one my parents grew up in. It seems like nobody just "kicks it" anymore. Maybe it's just being in my late 20s in a hyper-individualistic society. But whatever the case, my generation is addicted to the simulation. <sup>[1]</sup></p>

        <p><h3>Right. So what are we to do?</h3></p>

        <p>7. While we must continue to sustain pressure on politicians, we must also take matters into our own hands, and develop eco-friendly ways to live, to clean the environment, to manage waste, to work together, truly hearing each other across partisan boundaries. We must build a brighter future for our descendants. Future generations deserve to inherit a good planet, or at least a community that is creating good on Earth.</p>

        <p>8. In engineering and business alike, there is a principle to start small, and scale up. This means, for enormous problems, a good way to find a solution is to create something small, test it until it works well, then make it bigger.<br>
        – We don't need to move the Earth in a day to feel satisfied. We merely need to see ourselves making progress each day.</p>

        <p>9. This website is a way for me to keep track of the flow of ideas as they pass through my mind. There are so many ways to attack the modern ecological crises, and as a creative person with ADHD, I have an abundance of ideas. I think there's value in each of them, but of course, a positive action is worth many thousands of words.</p>

        <p>10. Through this blog, I will keep track of ideas, actions, priorities.</p>

        <p>11. I hope to see these ideas grow and flourish. I hope to continue to link with people who are doing the work, too. There are so many. The little pockets of love and heaven created by communities sustain us through life. I hope to someday look back on this first blog post fondly.</p>

        <p>13. In essence, each post on this website is a seed. Care will be required to nourish each seed into a budding sapling. Someday, we hope to see the trees, bushes, flowers, vines, and mycelial networks that will grow in the fertile ground of community care. This website is merely a way to keep track of ideas, and direct people towards action.</p>

        <h3>From the ashes rise the phoenix. The end of one world marks the beginning of another. Let's start building the future we want to see, so when the time comes, we can pass it to capable hands. Solutions exist, they just take work to implement. Let's do the work together.</h3>

        <p>---------------------------</p>

        <p><small><sup>[1]</sup> By "the simulation," I don't mean some schizo concept. I mean the applications developed by tech companies to compartmentalize certain aspects of our lives into a digital format, which is then often preferred to the original "real" version. Social media, in short.</small></p>
